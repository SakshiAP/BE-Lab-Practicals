## Lab Practice-III (Information Retrieval in AI Lab)

This repository contains lab practicals for the Information Retrieval in AI Lab at SPPU Pune University. These are the practicals for the final year Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning students.

### Group A: CO1, 2, 3 (Any two)

1. Implement a Conflation algorithm to generate a document representative of a text file.
2. Implement Single-pass Algorithm for the clustering of files. (Consider 4 to 5 files).
3. Implement a program for retrieval of documents using inverted files.

### Group B: CO3, 5 (Any two)

1. Implement a program to calculate precision and recall for sample input. (Answer set A, Query q1, Relevant documents to query q1 - Rq1).
2. Write a program to calculate the harmonic mean (F-measure) and E-measure for the above example.
3. Implement a program for feature extraction in 2D color images (any features like color, texture, etc.) and extract features from the input image and plot a histogram for the features.

### Group C: CO4, 5 (Any two)

1. Build the web crawler to pull product information and links from an e-commerce website. (Python).
2. Write a program to find the live weather report (temperature, wind speed, description, and weather) of a given city. (Python).
3. Case study on a recommender system for a product/Doctor/Product price/Music.

## Lab Practice-IV (Deep Learning for AI Lab)

This section contains practicals for the Deep Learning for AI Lab.

### Study of Deep Learning Packages

- Tensorflow, Keras, Theano, and PyTorch. Document the distinct features and functionality of the packages.

### Implementing Feed-forward neural networks with Keras and TensorFlow

1. Import the necessary packages.
2. Load the training and testing data (MNIST/CIFAR10).
3. Define the network architecture using Keras.
4. Train the model using SGD.
5. Evaluate the network.
6. Plot the training loss and accuracy.

### Build the Image classification model

1. Loading and preprocessing the image data.
2. Defining the model's architecture.
3. Training the model.
4. Estimating the model's performance.

### Use Autoencoder to implement anomaly detection

1. Import required libraries.
2. Upload/access the dataset.
3. The encoder converts it into a latent representation.
4. Decoder networks convert it back to the original input.
5. Compile the models with Optimizer, Loss, and Evaluation Metrics.

### Implement the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model

1. Data preparation.
2. Generate training data.
3. Train model.
4. Output.

### Object detection using Transfer Learning of CNN architectures

1. Load in a pre-trained CNN model trained on a large dataset.
2. Freeze parameters (weights) in the model's lower convolutional layers.
3. Add a custom classifier with several layers of trainable parameters to the model.
4. Train classifier layers on training data available for the task.
5. Fine-tune hyperparameters and unfreeze more layers as needed.
