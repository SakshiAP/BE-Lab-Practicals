# BE Lab Practicals

Welcome to the BE Lab Practicals repository for SPPU Pune University, which focuses on practical exercises in the fields of Information Retrieval in AI and Deep Learning for AI. This repository serves as a valuable resource for final year Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning students.

## Lab Practice-III (Information Retrieval in AI Lab)

### Group A: CO1, 2, 3 (Any two)
1. **Conflation Algorithm:** Implement a conflation algorithm to generate a document representative of a text file.
2. **Single-pass Clustering:** Implement a single-pass algorithm for the clustering of files, considering 4 to 5 files.
3. **Document Retrieval:** Implement a program for the retrieval of documents using inverted files.

### Group B: CO3, 5 (Any two)
1. **Precision and Recall:** Write a program to calculate precision and recall for a sample input (Answer set A, Query q1, Relevant documents to query q1 - Rq1).
2. **Harmonic Mean (F-measure) and E-measure:** Write a program to calculate the harmonic mean (F-measure) and E-measure for the above example.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Implement a program for feature extraction in 2D color images, extract features from the input image, and plot a histogram for the features.

### Group C: CO4, 5 (Any two)
1. **Web Crawler:** Build a web crawler in Python to pull product information and links from an e-commerce website.
2. **Live Weather Report:** Write a Python program to find the live weather report (temperature, wind speed, description, and weather) of a given city.
3. **Recommender System Case Study:** Conduct a case study on a recommender system for a product, doctor, product price, or music.

## Lab Practice-IV (Deep Learning for AI Lab)

### Topics Covered:
1. **Study of Deep Learning Packages:** Explore Tensorflow, Keras, Theano, and PyTorch, documenting their distinct features and functionality.
2. **Feed-forward Neural Networks:** Implement feed-forward neural networks with Keras and TensorFlow, including data loading, model architecture definition, training, evaluation, and performance plotting.
3. **Image Classification Model:** Build an image classification model with stages for loading and preprocessing image data, defining the model's architecture, training the model, and estimating its performance.
4. **Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection using an autoencoder, including importing libraries, dataset handling, encoding, decoding, model compilation, and evaluation metrics.
5. **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model:** Implement the CBOW model, involving data preparation, training data generation, model training, and output.
6. **Object Detection using Transfer Learning:** Implement object detection using transfer learning of CNN architectures, including loading a pre-trained model, custom classifier addition, training, fine-tuning, and model adjustments.
