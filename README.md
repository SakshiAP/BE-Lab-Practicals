# BE Lab Practicals

Welcome to the "BE Lab Practicals" repository, specifically designed for students of SPPU Pune University's Final Year Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Lab. This repository hosts lab practicals for two crucial subjects, namely:

## Lab Practice-III: Information Retrieval in AI Lab

### Group A: CO1, 2, 3 (Choose any two)

1. **Conflation Algorithm**: Implement a conflation algorithm to generate a document representative of a text file.

2. **Single-pass Algorithm for Clustering**: Implement a single-pass algorithm for the clustering of files (consider 4 to 5 files).

3. **Document Retrieval using Inverted Files**: Implement a program for the retrieval of documents using inverted files.

### Group B: CO3, 5 (Choose any two)

4. **Precision and Recall Calculation**: Implement a program to calculate precision and recall for sample input (Answer set A, Query q1, Relevant documents to query q1 - Rq1).

5. **Harmonic Mean (F-measure) and E-measure**: Write a program to calculate the harmonic mean (F-measure) and E-measure for the above example.

6. **Feature Extraction in 2D Color Images**: Implement a program for feature extraction in 2D color images (e.g., color, texture). Extract features from the input image and plot a histogram for the features.

### Group C: CO4, 5 (Choose any two)

7. **Web Crawler**: Build a web crawler to pull product information and links from an e-commerce website using Python.

8. **Live Weather Report**: Write a program to find the live weather report (temperature, wind speed, description, and weather) of a given city using Python.

9. **Case Study on Recommender System**: Conduct a case study on a recommender system for a product, doctor, product price, or music.

## Lab Practice-IV: Deep Learning for AI Lab

1. **Study of Deep Learning Packages**: Explore and document the distinct features and functionality of deep learning packages such as Tensorflow, Keras, Theano, and PyTorch.

2. **Feed-forward Neural Networks with Keras and TensorFlow**: Implement feed-forward neural networks using Keras and TensorFlow. This includes data loading, defining network architecture, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

3. **Image Classification Model**: Build an image classification model in four stages: data loading and preprocessing, defining the model's architecture, training, and performance estimation.

4. **Anomaly Detection with Autoencoder**: Implement anomaly detection using an autoencoder. The process involves importing libraries, accessing datasets, encoder-decoder networks, and model compilation.

5. **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model**: Implement the CBOW model for word embeddings. This includes data preparation, training data generation, model training, and output generation.

6. **Object Detection using Transfer Learning**: Perform object detection using transfer learning with pre-trained CNN models. This involves loading a pre-trained model, custom classifier, training, fine-tuning, and unfreezing layers as needed.
