# BE-Lab-Practicals

Welcome to the BE Lab Practical repository for SPPU Pune University. This repository is a comprehensive resource for students in the final year of the Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning program. Here, you will find lab practices and exercises related to Information Retrieval in AI and Deep Learning for AI.

## Lab Practice-III (Information Retrieval in AI Lab)

### Group A: CO1, 2, 3 (Any two)

1. **Conflation Algorithm**: Implement a Conflation algorithm to generate a document representative of a text file.
   
2. **Single-pass Clustering**: Implement a Single-pass Algorithm for the clustering of files (consider 4 to 5 files).
   
3. **Document Retrieval**: Implement a program for the retrieval of documents using inverted files.

### Group B: CO3, 5 (Any two)

1. **Precision and Recall**: Implement a program to calculate precision and recall for sample input (Answer set A, Query q1, Relevant documents to query q1 - Rq1).
   
2. **F-measure and E-measure**: Write a program to calculate the harmonic mean (F-measure) and E-measure for the above example.
   
3. **Feature Extraction**: Implement a program for feature extraction in 2D color images. Extract features from the input image and plot a histogram for the features.

### Group C: CO4, 5 (Any two)

1. **Web Crawler**: Build a web crawler to pull product information and links from an e-commerce website (Python).
   
2. **Weather Report**: Write a program to find the live weather report (temperature, wind speed, description, and weather) of a given city (Python).
   
3. **Recommender System**: Case study on a recommender system for a product, doctor, product price, or music.

## Lab Practice-IV (Deep Learning for AI Lab)

### Contents

1. **Study of Deep Learning Packages**: Explore Tensorflow, Keras, Theano, and PyTorch. Document the distinct features and functionality of these packages.

2. **Feed-forward Neural Networks with Keras and TensorFlow**:
   - Import the necessary packages.
   - Load the training and testing data (MNIST/CIFAR10).
   - Define the network architecture using Keras.
   - Train the model using SGD.
   - Evaluate the network.
   - Plot the training loss and accuracy.

3. **Image Classification Model**:
   - Loading and preprocessing the image data.
   - Defining the model's architecture.
   - Training the model.
   - Estimating the model's performance.

4. **Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection**:
   - Import required libraries.
   - Upload/access the dataset.
   - The encoder converts it into a latent representation.
   - Decoder networks convert it back to the original input.
   - Compile the models with Optimizer, Loss, and Evaluation Metrics.

5. **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model**:
   - Data preparation.
   - Generate training data.
   - Train the model.
   - Output.

6. **Object Detection using Transfer Learning**:
   - Load a pre-trained CNN model.
   - Freeze parameters(weights) in the model's lower convolutional layers.
   - Add a custom classifier with trainable parameters.
   - Train classifier layers on training data.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters and unfreeze more layers as needed.
